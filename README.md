# AI Gahaku & Racial Bias in Facial Recognition Algorithms

## Introduction

## Literature review

## Methodology

Evaluating the biases of an AI art generator - AI Gahaku which generates painting in different styles based on a picture.

Our aim is to identify whether the AI underperforms when creating images based on pictures of non-Caucasian people. The first stage of our research consisted in gathering a dataset of faces from different ethnicities. To do so, we relied on the work of K채rkk채inen and Joo (2021) who constructed a dataset aiming at solving the biases that other public face image datasets had toward Caucasian faces. They argue that most datasets tend to significantly underrepresent non-Caucasian faces and created an inclusive dataset to mitigate the race bias problem (K채rkk채inen and Joo, 2021, p. 1548). They defined the following seven race groups: Black, East Asian, Indian, Latino, Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian and White. We created 3 groups out of these seven categories, two treatment groups: Black and East Asian and a control group: White. As an overwhelming majority of Northern Renaissance Paintings feature white people, we assume that their representation will be the most accurate. We picked two groups that are typically underrepresented in this style to help us to assess whether a bias does indeed exist, and if yes whether it is similar for both groups or not. 
We selected a total of 45 pictures (15 per groups) and generated portraits using the AI-Gahaku mobile application. Furthermore, to evaluate whether the biases where only limited to one specific type of painting, we di
